## About this repo

The purpose of this repo is to provide a "crash course" style intro to Angular, its capabilities and some good practices.
It is not (and should not be) considered a full course, for that please take the time and go through some online courses.
Also, it does not explain everything, it is just enough to get anyone started fast.

There are a few files included for you to use to save some typing, but to create the project on your machine
you need to do it yourselves, this will help you understand the progression.

The tutorials are easy to follow and yield immediate results, so have fun building Angular + Node.js apps!
